== Crypto Fundamentals
This chapter is intended to serve as a reference manual for all the crypto fundamentals that our rollup will be built in. It is directed to people who are new to the space or for those who need a _quick rundown_. 

The field of cryptography is quite vast, and the realm of zero-knowledge proofs is rapidly evolving. This chapter will also serve as a compilation of useful and interesting resources to expand on the topics covered. If math does not scare you, make sure to check them out.


=== Hashing Functions


The EVM (and by extension Solidity) has several hashing functions that are natively supported.

=== Merkle Trees


=== Public Key Cryptography and Signatures


=== Zero Knowledge Proofs


=== SNARKs


=== STARKs
